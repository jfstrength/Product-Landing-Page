  <h2>About us</h2>
  <p>Literary Garden began as a sapling initiative in 2007 when Portland resident David Stevens began to feel guilty about his voracious appetite for books. David loved to read, but not as much as he loved the trees he read under. So, he thought "I should really buy a Kindle or something,". And though he did just that, the remaining heaps of usable paper on his bookshelf became the "something" we now know as Literary Garden. Today, our organization has helped over 20,000 people recycle their old books and has saved over 400 whole trees. Join us and help make a smarter, cleaner Earth.<p>
